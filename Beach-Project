## Loading Beach Data 
```{r}
Beach <- read.csv("beach_data.csv")
summary(Beach)
```

## Answering some questions about our data
## 1. What is the mean and standard deviation of the weights?
```{r}
sd(Beach$Weight)
mean(Beach$Weight)
```

## 2. Plot the weights 
```{r}
barplot(Beach$Weight, names = Beach$Sample, col = "steelblue")
```

## 3. Is there a difference in weight between the animals?
```{r}
aov(Beach$Weight~Beach$Animal)
summary(aov(Beach$Weight~Beach$Animal))
```

## 4. What about the relationship between weight and tidal zone of animals?
```{r}
summary(aov(Beach$Weight~Beach$Zone))
```

We find out that the mean weight of all animals in the data set is 22.6kg. Also we realized there is a relationship between weight and animals or tidal zones is significant and not due to chance. 

## Evaluating the anova model assumptions
```{r}
anova1 <- lm(Beach$Weight~Beach$Animal, data = Beach)
plot(density(anova1$residuals))
```

```{r}
anova2 <- lm(Beach$Weight~Beach$Zone, data = Beach)
plot(density(anova2$residuals))
```
